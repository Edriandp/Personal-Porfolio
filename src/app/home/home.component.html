            <p class="text-start mt-2">Hello! My name is Edrian.<br><br>
                Since I can remember, I've been fascinated by technology. I love exploring new tools, learning about software development, and challenging myself to create innovative solutions.<br>
                I consider myself a self-taught person who, over time and with formal education, has acquired knowledge in web and mobile development, database management, and application deployment.<br>
                ðŸ’¡ I'm always looking for new challenges that allow me to grow and improve my skills.<br>
                ðŸ‘¬ Open to working in a team and growing alongside my peers.
